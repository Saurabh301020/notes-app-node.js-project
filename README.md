I will run in the terminal so there is few command to use it!

1.- To adding the notes (node app.js add --title='title for your note' --body='give the body for your note! ')

2.- To removing the note (node app.js remove --title='title of your note which you want to remove!')

3.- To view all notes (node app.js list)
